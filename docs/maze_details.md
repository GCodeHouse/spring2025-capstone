Design Considerations

1. Game Type & Flow
-Single-player vs. Multiplayer: Single-player is simpler to scope and test. Multiplayer adds complexity with real-time sync and state management.
- Turn-based vs. Real-time: Turn-based allows easier server-side validation and pacing. Real-time requires more frequent updates and latency handling.
- Maze Generation: Decide between static mazes or procedurally generated ones. Procedural generation adds replayability but requires algorithmic logic (e.g., DFS, Prim’s).

2. Client-Server Interaction
- Read-only API: Use server to fetch maze layouts, player stats, or leaderboard data. No need for persistent user state unless you expand scope.
- Asynchronous Fetching: Use `fetch()` or `axios` in React to retrieve maze data or hints from the server. Consider loading states and error handling.

3. UI/UX Design
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader support.
- Responsiveness: Ensure the game scales across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Feedback: Visual cues for movement, collisions, and goal completion.

4. Game Logic
- Collision Detection: Prevent movement through walls.
- Win Condition: Define clear goals (e.g., reach the exit, collect items).
- Timer or Score: Optional features to increase challenge and track performance.

5. Framework Use
- React: Ideal for managing game state, rendering maze grid, and handling user input.
- Component Structure: MazeGrid, Player, HUD, ServerDataFetcher, etc.

6. Data Visualization
- Stats Dashboard: Show time taken, moves made, or maze difficulty.
- Leaderboard: Pull top scores from server (read-only).


Constraints

1. Scope Management
- Keep the game loop and server interaction lightweight to avoid overengineering.
- Limit maze size or complexity to ensure performance and clarity.

2. Server Limitations
- If using a public API or mock server, ensure it supports CORS and doesn’t require authentication.
- Read-only means no saving progress or user profiles unless you simulate it locally.

3. Performance
- Avoid excessive re-renders in React. Use memoization or state batching if needed.
- Optimize maze rendering (e.g., use canvas or SVG for large grids).

4. Time & Resources
- Balance ambition with feasibility—focus on core mechanics first, then polish.
- Use placeholder assets or simple CSS for visuals unless you have time for design.
