# Scoring System

## Collectible item-based scoring

- Divide collectibles into "edible", "inedible", "dietary-restricted", score accordingly
  - Edible, requested: +X points
  - Dietary-restricted: -X points
  - Inedible: -Y points where Y > X (inedible is worse than dietary-restricted)
  - (Stretch feature) Edible, non-dietary restricted: rand(-Z, +Z) value w/ customer comment
  - (Stretch feature) 2 difficulty levels
    - Easy mode: Collecting inedible item loses points
    - Hard mode: Collecting inedible item = level over

- Bonus multiplier for matching recipe exactly

## Timer-based scoring

- Assume (for now) 90s to complete maze
- Score multiplier for completing maze in less than:
  - 15s: 8X (where X = value for edible, requested items)
  - 30s: 4X (same as above)
  - 60s: 2X (same as above)
  - > 60s: 1X (same as above)

## Per-level scoring formula

([Total score at end of maze run w/ floor of 0 to avoid negative numbers)*
(1.Q where Q is the number of ingredients in the recipe if recipe is matched perfectly])
+
(Timer-based scoring value)
= Total score

## Win conditions

- Get from starting position to ending position/maze exit before timer runs out
- Positive final score

## Loss conditions

- Total points <= 0
- Timer runs out before getting to ending position/maze exit
- (Stretch feature) Collecting inedible item on "Hard Mode" difficulty
